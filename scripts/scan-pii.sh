# Prism — PII Denylist Scanner
# ============================================================================
# Greps tracked files for items in a maintainer-curated personal denylist.
# Catches the cross-artifact-shape bug class where a fixture LOOKS fictional
# but actually uses real names / addresses / phones the maintainer happens
# to know. LLM review can't tell 'Eric in a mock' from 'Eric who lives at
# this house'; a denylist can.
#
# DENYLIST FILE
# -------------
# Path: $PRISM_PII_DENYLIST (env var) OR ~/.config/prism-pii-denylist.txt
#
# Format (one entry per line):
#     # Comments start with hash. Blank lines ignored.
#     RealFirstName
#     RealLastName
#     742 Real Street
#     real.email@example.com
#     5551234567
#
# The denylist itself MUST live outside the repo and MUST NOT be committed.
# Each maintainer populates their own. Categories to consider:
#   - Real names of household members (first AND last)
#   - Street addresses, school names, employer names
#   - Phone numbers (anything not in 555-01xx reserved-for-fiction)
#   - Email addresses other than the maintainer's public commit identity
#   - Personal GPS coordinates (for travel feature)
#
# USAGE
# -----
#   bash scripts/scan-pii.sh                 # scan tracked files
#   PRISM_PII_DENYLIST=/path/to/list bash scripts/scan-pii.sh
#
# Exits 0 if clean OR if no denylist file exists (with a warning).
# Exits 1 if any tracked file contains a denylist entry.
#
# Wire into git via .husky/pre-push or .git/hooks/pre-push to run before
# every push. The cost of an extra grep is far smaller than a public PII
# leak.

To enable PII scanning, create the file with one entry per line.
See docs/code-review-modalities.md (TODO #5) for guidance on what to include.
